This repository contains code for performing semantic segmentation using the DeepLabv3 model. Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into a predefined set of classes, thus dividing the image into meaningful segments. The DeepLabv3 model is a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture designed for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation.

## Features
1. **DeepLabv3 Model**: Utilizes a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) based on a modified version of the ResNet architecture, incorporating atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) for multi-scale feature representation.
2. **Custom Color Mapping**: Generates custom color maps for visualizing segmentation results, ensuring that each class is represented by a distinct color.
3. **Flexible Usage**: Easily adaptable to different datasets and image inputs, with options for customizing input image size and output resolution.

## Usage
1. **Download Model**: Download the DeepLabv3 model and extract the files into the appropriate directory.
2. **Perform Segmentation**: Run the provided script to perform semantic segmentation on input images.

## Requirements
1. MATLAB
2. DeepLabv3 model files
3. Sample images for testing and evaluation
